  I led the development of a REST API designed to fetch, process, and serve data from external sources. 
  Using Node.js for the backend, I built and configured multiple API endpoints to handle various 
  requests efficiently.

The API was designed to integrate seamlessly with external systems, providing reliable and fast data processing.

My role included designing the API structure, implementing the endpoints, and ensuring that the 
system could handle high traffic with optimal performance. I also focused on maintaining clean, well documented code and implemented error handling and security measures to protect the data.
