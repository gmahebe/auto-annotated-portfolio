My responsibilities included collaborating with the finance department to map data from QuickBooks to corresponding fields in NetSuite. This process involved extensive data cleaning and preparation to ensure accuracy and consistency across departments.

I was also responsible for documenting the technical workflows to ensure a smooth migration 
process, providing a reference for future updates. Additionally, I played a key role in configuring 
NetSuite to align with the companyâ€™s internal processes, ensuring that the system was tailored to 
meet specific operational needs.

Key Contributions:

> Worked closely with the finance team to identify and map data between systems.

> Prepared and cleaned data, ensuring accuracy for a seamless migration.

> Configured NetSuite to optimize and streamline company processes.

> Documented technical workflows to ensure an efficient and repeatable migration process
