  I developed a custom WordPress theme that included a dynamic section to fetch and display posts 
  with advanced filtering options. The theme featured pagination and a filter system powered by AJAX 
  to provide a seamless user experience, allowing users to view and filter content without reloading 
  the page.

To achieve this, I wrote a custom function to handle the filtering logic and utilized WordPress hooks 
to extend the core functionality, enabling the custom filter. In addition to ensuring smooth 
functionality, I also implemented SEO best practices to optimize the site for search engines, 
improving its visibility and ranking.
